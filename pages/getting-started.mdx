# Getting Started

Set up your WaaP wallet in minutes.

## Create Your Wallet

1. Visit the app where WaaP is integrated

## No Seed Phrase?

That's right. WaaP doesn't use seed phrases. Instead, your keys are split using two-party computation:

- **Your share** — derived from your login credentials
- **Network share** — held by the decentralized WaaP network

Neither share alone can sign transactions. This means:
- No seed phrase to lose or get stolen
- No single point of failure
- True self-custody without the complexity
