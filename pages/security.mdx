# Security

How WaaP keeps your funds safe.

## Two-Party Computation (2PC)

Your private key never exists in one place. WaaP splits signing authority:

| Share | Location | Can sign alone? |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Your share | Your device | No |
| Network share | Decentralized network | No |

Both shares are required to sign any transaction. This means:
- If your device is compromised, attackers can't move funds
- If the network is compromised, attackers can't move funds
- Only you can authorize transactions

## No Seed Phrases

Seed phrases are the #1 attack vector in crypto. WaaP eliminates them entirely:
- Nothing to write down
- Nothing to store insecurely
- Nothing to get phished

## Transaction Scanning

Before you sign, WaaP scans transactions for:
- Malicious contracts
- Phishing attempts
- Unusual patterns
