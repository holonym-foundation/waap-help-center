# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is WaaP?

WaaP (Wallet as a Protocol) is a self-custodial wallet that doesn't require seed phrases. It uses two-party computation to split your keys between your device and a decentralized network, so no single party can access your funds.

### Is WaaP free?

Yes. WaaP is free for users. You only pay network gas fees for transactions.

### What chains does WaaP support?

WaaP supports EVM chains (Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.) and Sui. More chains are coming.

## Security

### Where are my keys stored?

Your keys are split into two shares:
- One share on your device (derived from your login)
- One share on the decentralized WaaP network

Neither share alone can sign transactions.

### What if I lose my phone?

You can recover access using any login method you've set up (email, phone, Google, etc.). We recommend setting up multiple methods.

### Can WaaP access my funds?

No. WaaP only holds one share of your key. Without your share, no one — including WaaP — can move your funds.

### Is WaaP audited?

Yes. WaaP has been audited by Cure53, Hexens, Least Authority, and Halborn.

## Using WaaP

### How do I back up my wallet?

You don't need to. Your wallet is tied to your login credentials. As long as you can log in, you have access.

### Can I use WaaP with hardware wallets?

WaaP is designed to provide hardware-wallet-level security without a physical device. Hardware wallet integration is not currently supported.

### How do I export my keys?

Key export is available for users who need it. This generates a standard private key you can import elsewhere. Note: once exported, your security model changes to a traditional single-key setup.
