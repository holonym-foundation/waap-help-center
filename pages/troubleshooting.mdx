# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Transaction Stuck

If your transaction is pending for a long time:

1. Check the network status — congestion can cause delays
2. Wait for confirmation — most transactions confirm within minutes
3. If stuck for 24+ hours, contact support

## Can't Connect

If you're having trouble connecting your wallet:

1. **Refresh the page** — simple but often works
2. **Clear browser cache** — old data can cause issues
3. **Try a different browser** — some extensions can interfere
4. **Disable ad blockers** — they sometimes block wallet connections

## Login Issues

If you can't log in:

1. **Check your email/phone** — make sure you're using the right one
2. **Check spam folder** — verification emails sometimes land there
3. **Try a different method** — if you set up multiple login options

## Wrong Network

If you're on the wrong network:

1. Look for a network switcher in the app
2. Select the correct network
3. Your balance will update automatically
